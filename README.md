# Project: Pretty Cool Manel Blog

This is the GitHub repository for the project you named "tufteblog", generated from the "yaxt-tinysites-tufte" website template at [yax.com](https://yax.com).

From here, deploy your website for free hosting. Just click a button to deploy your website to [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/), [Vercel](https://vercel.com/), or [Render.com](https://render.com/).

# Tiny Site: Tufte

This is a one page "tiny site" built using the [yax.com](https://yax.com/) website builder project.

You can edit the page using the [Mavo](https://mavo.io/) on-page editor. Use the link `https://example.com/index.html?login` to open the edit toolbar. Click "Edit" in the toolbar to begin editing.
